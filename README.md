# AkashGanga - Exoplanet Exploration Platform

**AkashGanga** is an interactive platform that enables users to explore exoplanets and celestial wonders through immersive 3D models, images, and real-time data. The platform integrates resources from NASA to provide a visual and educational experience, allowing users to learn more about distant worlds and the mysteries of the cosmos.

## Project Overview

AkashGanga focuses on bringing the universe closer to you. With an intuitive interface and 3D models, users can view exoplanets up close, access scientific information, and immerse themselves in the discoveries of space exploration. Our repository hosts all necessary resources to help users dive into the exoplanetary systems we've explored.

## Exoplanets Featured in AkashGanga

### 1. **Proxima Centauri b**
- **Distance:** 4.24 light-years from Earth.
- **Star:** Orbits the red dwarf Proxima Centauri.
- **Mass:** Minimum mass is 1.17 times that of Earth.
- **Orbit Duration:** Completes an orbit in 11.2 days.
- **Habitable Zone:** Potential for liquid water exists.

### 2. **LHS 1140 b**
- **Distance:** 41 light-years from Earth.
- **Star:** Orbits a red dwarf (LHS 1140) in the habitable zone.
- **Mass:** About 6.6 times Earth's mass.
- **Orbit Duration:** 24.7 Earth days.
- **Significance:** May have retained a thick atmosphere, making it a prime candidate for habitability studies.

### 3. **Kepler-452 b**
- **Distance:** 1,400 light-years from Earth.
- **Star:** Orbits a Sun-like star.
- **Mass:** Roughly 5 times that of Earth.
- **Orbit Duration:** 385 days.
- **Habitable Zone:** Located in the star's habitable zone, it is sometimes called Earth's "cousin."

### 4. **Kepler-22 b**
- **Distance:** 600 light-years from Earth.
- **Star:** Orbits a G-type star similar to our Sun.
- **Mass:** Estimated to be about 2.4 times Earth's.
- **Orbit Duration:** 289 days.
- **Potential:** May have liquid water, increasing its potential for supporting life.

### 5. **LP 791-18 d**
- **Distance:** 90 light-years from Earth.
- **Star:** Orbits a red dwarf in the system LP 791-18.
- **Mass:** Slightly larger than Earth.
- **Significance:** Located in the star’s habitable zone, and may have conditions suitable for life.

### 6. **WASP-12 b**
- **Distance:** 1,400 light-years from Earth.
- **Type:** A hot Jupiter, very close to its star.
- **Orbit Duration:** 1.09 days.
- **Significance:** Its proximity to its star causes it to be deformed into an egg shape due to strong tidal forces.

### 7. **55 Cancri e**
- **Distance:** 41 light-years from Earth.
- **Type:** Super-Earth, with a surface temperature of over 2,000°C.
- **Mass:** Roughly 8 times Earth's mass.
- **Orbit Duration:** 18 hours.
- **Significance:** May have a carbon-rich core, leading to the theory that it could be a "diamond planet."
